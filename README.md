ERD Diagram.png is a screenshot from QuickDBD

The first time I submitted this I did not get all the points and the only negative comment was that items in the dept_mgr and dept_emp were not marked as NOT NULL. They were not marked that way because they are part of a composite primary key, so they are NOT NULL by default. The only change I've made in resubmitting this is to add a screenshot proving that they are NOT NULL.
